# Lending-club-loan-analysis-and-prediction
A Lending club loan data collected from year 2007-2011 was analyzed, the important features and their correlations were derived which helped to predict whether a consumer can pay the debt or is severely delinquent on a debt.

Data collected from:-https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

Not all these columns contain meaningful (or any) information so they needed cleaning. 

Thus important attributes were discovered using various types of data visualization techniques on those features.

This process lead us into default prediction, and helped to identify the columns that directly effected how the loan will behave.
